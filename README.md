# selenium_vaccin

An ugly notebook to find a vaccination appointment slot for my dad.

- most of the vaccination center are full, that's ridiculous.
- I ain't got the time to check it every 20 min, rather make use of my pricey tuition fees to write something useful. 
- send a **biip** and return the url if slots are available in one center (mp3 file in the git) 

- done using **Selenium** (it's really fun)
- I know, the Russian doll -like of  **Try-Catch** is ugly.
