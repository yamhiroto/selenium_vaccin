# selenium_vaccin

An ugly notebook usually built to find a vaccination appointment slot for my **dad**.

- Most of the vaccination centers are full, that's ridiculous.
- I ain't got the time to check it every 20 min, rather make use of my pricey tuition fees to write something helpful. 
- Send a **notification sound** and return the url if slots are available in one center (mp3 file in the git) 
- BE VERY FAST TO BOOK AS SOON AS YOU SEE A SLOT, please make sure you have all the relevant personal info for the person you are booking for beforehands
- Done using **Selenium** (it is really fun)
- I know, the Russian doll -like of  **Try&Catch** is ugly.
